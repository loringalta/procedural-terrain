It has been 32 years since Ken Perlin won an Academy Award for his develop- ment of Perlin Noise while working on the movie Tron. Since then, not much  has changed in the world of procedural terrain generation. One reason is that  the inherent “randomness” of procedural techniques hinders its implementation  in the real world. Perlin Noise allows the user some degree of control, which is  immensely useful when designing worlds, and games in which the user has to  have a coherent and non-volatile experience. However, Procedural Generation  Techniques are fast and most importantly easy to understand and use. I im- plemented the following algorithms by using heightmaps. They are simple 2D  arrays of values that represent the heights of the terrain. Limitations of this  approach include the inability to produce caves or overhangs.
